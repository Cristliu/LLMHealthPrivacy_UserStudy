            In this survey, the AI-large-scale-model (also known as LLM) acts like a virtual doctor,
             capable of answering any consultation questions about health issues through learning a vast amount of medical knowledge.</p>

            <p class="index_p_margin"><strong>Purpose of the Survey:</strong>
            This survey aims to understand users' experiences with LLM-based healthcare consultation services,
             to better understand users’ views on the service, and to design safer and more user-expected services.</p>

            <p class="index_p_margin"><strong>Survey Procedure:</strong>
            The survey is expected to take 5-10 minutes.
            You will first pose some health-related questions to the LLM-based healthcare chatbot and read its replies.
            Afterwards, you will need to answer questions about your experience and views in the questionnaire,
             and provide some basic but non-privacy-invading information.
            </p>

            <p class="index_p_margin"><strong>Benefits and Compensation:</strong>
            Possible benefits of participating in this survey include increasing your understanding of LLM technology and answering your health questions.
            After completing the entire survey, you will receive a reward of 7 RMB.
            </p>

            <p class="index_p_margin"><strong>Notes and Reminders:</strong>
            （1）The advice you receive in the conversation with the healthcare chatbot is generated by the LLM from OpenAI.
            The advice needs to be reviewed by a doctor before it can be implemented, so please refer to it with caution.
            （2）Please do not enter any personal or sensitive information in the text boxes of the survey.
            </p>

            <p class="index_p_margin"><strong>Privacy and Risks:</strong>
            This survey follows national information protection regulations.
            （1）Before participating in the survey, you also need to agree to OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/">terms of use</a>,
            and read the <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>.
            （2）Apart from the automatic collection by OpenAI, we will not store any dialogue data between you and the healthcare robot.
            All data you provide in the questionnaire will only be used for our team's research and will be kept confidential and securely stored.
            （3）During the survey, your device's IP address will be temporarily collected to limit duplicate participation and identify the city you are in.
            When claiming the reward, an anonymous field openid of your WeChat will be collected, but it cannot identify your account information or other personal information.
            The collected IP addresses and openid will be deleted promptly and will not be used for analysis.
